# Educational Technology Plan

Provide a brief description of the purpose of your educational technology Plan

## Context

### Course

Describe your course including the name, description, and grade level

In this course middle school students will be introduced to the vast field of computer science through gaming and robotics. This course is designed for 7th and 8th grade students in a middle school setting. In addition students will be introduced to the basics of coding and those fundamental principles needed to understand commands in coding. 

Students will start the year working through coursework in CS First to gain a baseline understanding of block coding. Once that foundation has been established students will draw from their experiences to complete hands-on labs through VEX IQ that require robots to be built, coded, and tested to perform a variety of tasks. Students will have the opportunity to compete collaboratively with students from other schools at a VEX competition in the fall. At the conclusion of the VEX IQ competition season, students will transition to working on coursework through Elite Gaming Live Academy. EGL will introduce students to a variety of computer science pathways and match them to a curriculum path designed to their interests in computer science. Students who successfully earn enough points, from completion of coursework and projects, will be eligible to participate live in competitive gaming tournaments with other students across the country.  

### Situation

Provide relevant details about your course and/or school that will influence the decisions in the plan. What assets and constraints do you face? What is the context of your class, considering demographic and technical resources?

In order to effectively create a course designed on computer science stem based learning needs support for all the stakeholders involved. One of the greatest assets of our school is that we were founded under the belief that stem is an essential component of the learning process and our Admin supports the direction to create these opportunities for student engagement and enrichment. We have dedicated teachers who have taken on the task to create this new course for our students. Teachers who can work together and collaborate to strengthen the program and meet the goals established. 

One of the barriers that  teachers face is that this is a new field and area of study in the school. Having a group of experienced teachers who have established computer science programs to collaborate with can be a challenge, but through this course we have created relationships with teachers who are starting up their own computer science programs. Having a group of teachers who are going through similar experiences is truly an asset. 

A barrier that our students can face is the understanding and persevering through the learning process when learning something that can be difficult and confusing at times.  Learning about computer science is a commitment and they must be prepared to participate in the learning process. Learning about coding is a challenge and as teachers we will support them. Students must have an awareness that the gaming component of the course is a reward of their rich work they will be producing. Another barrier is having a solid understanding of math principles. For example, understanding the relationship between the X and Y axis of a graph. Also the basic understanding of integers.

in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, evidence-based and inclusive pedagogy.

Students will engage with the EGL website using a chromebook to complete coursework in their chosen gaming pathway. 

The crucial components of Introducing Computer Science to our students specifically coding. The approach that will support students with the basic understanding of coding and functions is  the Peer Instruction pedagogy. Providing students with the step by step hands on instruction can provide students with a model to follow and explore the functions. By introducing the material using block coding, students will be able to understand the basics of putting code together. The tools used to support this are Scratch and CS First through google which utilizes block coding. Class routine is essential and establishes a daily warm up to review the concept (function) of the previous lesson.  The Daily Warm-Up will give students a chance to practice and reflect on the lesson before and provide them to discuss how certain codes interact with the main program or set code. 

Students will be graded on the classroom and assignments they will be completing in class. Homework will be assigned only if classwork is not completed it will become home. Teachers will provide students with time between concepts and assignments. Keeping in mind that there is a  Digital divide in our community. Although some students live in town, others are coming from rural and the surrounding foothill area. We have to keep in mind for the students who do not have access to internet. Students who live in those rural areas are limited to the bandwidth and fast internet options. For those students in need, our school provides Verizon Mobile Internet. The speed of this supports students in working on web based software, but can be limiting on videos and high end internet use programs. Another divide is students who do not have access to computers. We are very fortunate to provide our students with a chromebook to bring down that digital divide. Students will have access to them everyday at home and at school. Some students have their own with higher processing speeds and hardware. 

  The class focus is utilizing the Peer Instruction pedagogy to support students in the questions and problems of the lesson. These step by step problems will be used to help generate a discussion with the students whole class. Although some students may be reluctant to share, utilizing groups will support students who tend to share their work with classmates. In addition, teachers will create group goals and activities for students to collaborate and solve problems and play with the coding functions. Our students will be able to apply this as real world practice in working with others on projects.  It is important that students can reflect and share their coding with other students because the language in coding can create frustrations if students get stuck or their code is full of errors. Allowing students to share with one another encourages students to explain to one another the errors and how to correct them.  The goal for the teacher is to create a collaborative environment for students to practice and learn coding. 

Furthermore, assessments are crucial when it comes to computer science, there are a number of basic functions and comprehension needed to write and explain what codes do. Students will be assessed throughout the course and the teacher will let students know ahead of time. One strategy to support assessments is using the Pair programming instruction. Allowing students to work with program problems that look specifically at the essential target standard (or code) with a partner can help build that confidence. The Pair programming Instruction allows students to have dedicated roles. As a teacher I can use this as an assessment tool. Students who take on the driver role can focus on the narrow coding typing and inputs. Meanwhile this allows the other student to focus on the “Big Picture”  and catch those errors and break down the road map of the solution to the problem. Using this informal approach allows the teacher to see which students understand coding while working with a partner. In addition the students create a formal assessment to be graded and used as the teacher uses the data to redirect instruction. I truly want my students to treat assessments as the growth goals. Students will be reflecting at the end of units and applying to computer science as a whole in mini write up journals. 

Incentives: As students continue to meet these goals, this will allow students to use the coding into their gaming aspect of the course. These bigger hands-on projects will be filled with set codes that help students apply what they have learned to the game. It is important to allow students to explore in this opportunity, this allows them to see potential avenues in higher education and career fields. 


### Impacts

How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or evolving course contexts.

One of the major draws of this course is the use of gaming, robotics, and competition to entice students to engage with the topics at hand. The ability to compete with students from across the nation has positive social impacts for our students. VEX IQ competitions require students to collaborate with students from different schools that they have met only moments before to come up with a plan to earn the most points possible during their collaborative match. They will have to depend upon skills in conflict resolution, healthy debate, and will have to take into account the various backgrounds and experience levels of their fellow players. Whether or not students venture into the career path of computer science these are skills they will take with them for life. 

Ensuring all students have access to technology is at the heart of this course in its focus that “all students learn” 

Another major component we would like to include in this course is a computer scientist of the week. Each week students will be introduced to someone who has contributed to the field of computer science. The goal with this element is to be able to focus on the underrepresented populations in the computer science field, women, people of color, and queer populations. It is important that students can envision themselves in this field and having role models that look like them is one way to work towards this goal. Our school is working on starting a Girls Who Code Club and I will be using that as an opportunity to create more interest around computer science and subsequently this course.
